# Lulzx

Generalist. Independent. Risk seeking.

I build at the intersection of **intelligence**, **abstraction**, and **infrastructure**. Spanning distributed systems, category theory, algebraic geometry, and AI. Alongside this, I explore human cognition and psychedelics.

My goal: scalable models of thought. Systems that learn, adapt, and reason like minds. Not just machines.
