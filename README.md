I am **Lulzx**, a generalist who's especially independent and risk seeking.

I build at the intersection of intelligence, abstraction, and infrastructure.

My work spans distributed systems, category theory, algebraic geometry, and AI-paired with deep explorations into human cognition and psychedelics. 

I'm designing scalable models of thought and systems that can learn, adapt, and reason like minds, not just machines.

I'm available for hire, [lulzx.com/hire](https://lulzx.com/hire)
